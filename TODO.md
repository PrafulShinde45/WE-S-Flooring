# TODO: Standardize Hero Sections for Gallery (Projects) and Contact Pages

## Tasks:
- [ ] Modify Hero.tsx to accept props for title, subtitle, buttonText, buttonHref, backgroundImage, and height
- [ ] Update src/app/projects/page.tsx to use the configurable Hero component with custom title and subtitle for projects
- [ ] Update src/app/contact/page.tsx to use the configurable Hero component with custom title and subtitle for contact
- [ ] Ensure all hero sections are full-screen and consistent with home and about pages
- [ ] Test the changes by running the development server and verifying the pages

## Notes:
- Use the same background image as home/about for consistency
- Projects page: Title "Our Completed Projects", Subtitle "Delivering excellence, one floor at a time."
- Contact page: Title "Contact Us", Subtitle "Crafting perfection from the ground up. Tell us about your space."
- Include a button on both pages linking to #contact
